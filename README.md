# Advent of Code 2023

This is my attempt at solving all puzzles in the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). Everything is written in Rust 1.74.0.

Since all puzzle inputs are personally generated, I've added the input files for each day as well.

Disclaimer: I'm new to Rust, so a lot of code is going to be very much `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`.
